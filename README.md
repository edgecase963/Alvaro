Below is a demonstration of how to set up a minimalistic server using Alvaro:

```python
import alvaro, asyncio

server = alvaro.Host("127.0.0.1", port=8888)
asyncio.run( server.start() )
```

Alvaro uses asyncio to host/run/manage its servers. In order to start a server, it must be started with the `asyncio.run` function.
